The planet of tippidy is just over the horizon but your ship has ended up in a bular-storm and the bulars have never been the most conciderate space-dwellers. For some reason thay are coming much too close for comfort.

Fire up the tactical-tick-attack and ward them off, there is safety if you can just reach the gravitational zone of Tippidy before the moon brings in hordes of mini-bulars that hide in its shadow.
